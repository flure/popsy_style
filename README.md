# popsy_style

This is the source code of a demo I made in 2012 (http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=60892)

There is only source code, no libs, no makefile.

Dependencies :
- DevIL
- SDL
- FMODEX

This source code is provided as is, with no license. Just do what you want with it.

There are two main files :
- popsystyle.c : this is the main demo source code.
- animtester.c : this is the source code to a viewer for sprite animation in PNG format.
